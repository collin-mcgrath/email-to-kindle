There are two branches in this repo:

* master - behaves as described in the [explanatory blogpost](https://petervojtek.github.io/diy/2015/07/28/share-messages-with-kindle-on-fridge.html)
* resize_images - same as above, and additionaly the image in attachment is scaled and auto-oriented. This feature is useful when sending large images in attachment as kindle is unable to properly display larger images (cca 3MPx+). You need to install imagemagick to use this feature(`apt-get install imagemagick`)
